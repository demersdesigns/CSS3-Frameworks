Intro to CSS3 Frameworks - Fall 2014
===============
A simple site design used as a teaching aid for the Intro to CSS Frameworks immersive session at [Startup Institute Boston]. This starter site served as a jumping off point for students to extend and modify based on additional business requiremenents that I identified in the session. Students used Bootstrap to add additional features and functionality.
